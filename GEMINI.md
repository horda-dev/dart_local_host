# Project: horda_local_host

## Project Overview

`horda_local_host` is a Dart project designed to act as a local host for running server packages developed with the `horda_server` framework. It leverages `build_runner` for code generation, specifically to create a `bin/main.dart` file that registers and launches "actors", "services", and "processes" defined within the project. This project is a core component for developing and testing applications built on the Horda framework.

**Key Technologies:**
*   **Dart:** The primary programming language.
*   **horda_core & horda_server:** Core dependencies for the Horda framework, likely providing the underlying architecture for actors, services, and processes.
*   **build_runner:** Used for code generation, automating the creation of boilerplate code, particularly the `main.dart` entry point.
*   **shelf & shelf_router:** Likely used for handling HTTP requests and routing within the local host environment.

## Building and Running

### 1. Install Dependencies
To fetch all necessary Dart packages, run:
```bash
dart pub get
```

### 2. Generate Code
This project uses `build_runner` to generate the `bin/main.dart` file, which is essential for running the application.
To generate the code:
```bash
dart run build_runner build
```
If you encounter issues or need to force a regeneration, you can clean the build cache first:
```bash
dart run build_runner clean
dart run build_runner build
```

### 3. Run the Application
After generating the `main.dart` file, you can run the local host:
```bash
dart bin/main.dart
```

### 4. Running Tests
To execute the project's tests, use the Dart test runner:
```bash
dart test
```

## Development Conventions

### Linting and Formatting
The project adheres to the following linting and formatting rules, as defined in `analysis_options.yaml`:
*   Includes `package:lints/recommended.yaml`.
*   Prefers single quotes (`prefer_single_quotes`).
*   Prefers relative imports (`prefer_relative_imports`).
*   Preserves trailing commas in code formatting.

### Code Generation
The `bin/main.dart` file is automatically generated by `build_runner`. **Do not edit this file manually.** Any changes made to `bin/main.dart` will be overwritten the next time `build_runner` is executed. To modify the application's startup logic, adjust the source files that feed into the code generation process (e.g., actor, service, and process definitions).
